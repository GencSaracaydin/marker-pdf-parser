# Procedure

## 1. Introduction
The successful clinical implementation of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells depends on the quantity and quality of the drug product, which are strongly affected by the manufacturing process. The critical attributes of CAR-T cell products are safety, purity, consistency, potency, and persistence. There are many ongoing efforts to replace the manual with automated and centralized point-of-care manufacturing processes, as well as a shift from ex vivo production toward the in vivo generation of CAR-T cells. 

## 2. Stable Gene Transfer by Transposases
Transposition is a process by which mobile genetic segments, called transposons or transposable elements, change their positions within a genome. The two most commonly used DNA transposons for the generation of CAR-T cells are Sleeping Beauty (SB) and PiggyBac (PB), both of which achieve stable, non-targeted gene transfer.

### 2.1. Sleeping Beauty
The SB transposase utilizes a cut-and-paste mechanism for gene integration of up to 8 kb in cargo size. The transposon DNA sequence includes the GOI and is flanked on both sides by terminal inverted repeats (TIR) that are 200â€“250 base pairs in length. Each TIR is bound specifically by two SB transposases forming a homodimer. 

### 2.2. PiggyBac
PiggyBac (PB) is also a class II transposon that originates from insects. In the transposition process, the PB transposase enzyme binds to the TIR sequences, excises the transposon, and integrates it at the TTAA chromosomal sites. 

## 3. Targeted Integration Using Programmable Endonucleases
Targeted integration of GOI can be achieved by co-delivery of programmable endonucleases, which induce double-strand breaks (DSBs) at selected sites in the genome, along with transgenes encoded within DNA repair template vectors.

### 3.1. Programmable Endonucleases: RNA-Guided Nucleases
The discovery of the CRISPR-Cas system has revolutionized the field of gene therapy due to its unparalleled versatility, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use.

### 3.2. Programmable Endonucleases: Protein-DNA Interaction-Guided Nucleases
Zinc-finger Nucleases (ZFNs), Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TAL-ENs), and Meganucleases are the most prominent programmable nucleases that use protein-based recognition of DNA motifs to mediate specificity.

### 3.3. Transgene Integration via Cellular DSB-Repair Mechanisms
Targeted transgene integration can be achieved by hijacking endogenous cellular DNA repair mechanisms that are activated upon the occurrence of a double-strand break.

## 4. Gene Transfer by Non-Integrating Vectors
A promising alternative for gene delivery in CAR-T cell immunotherapy is the use of non-integrating strategies. DNA- or mRNA-based vectors can deliver GOIs without requiring the co-delivery of any genomic editing machinery.

### 4.1. DNA-Based Vectors
Bacterial-derived plasmids have historically been the most frequently used DNA-based vectors in cancer gene therapy.

### 4.2. mRNA-Based Vectors
mRNA-based therapies have ushered in a new era in modern medicine and play a substantial role in the current immunotherapy clinical trial landscape.

| Transposase | Intermediate | Depends on the transposase (up to 100 kb) | Stable expression | Steerable by transposase activity | Intracellular detection depends on the encoded cDNA | Intermediate | Well represented in clinical trials |
| Programmable Endonuclease | Intermediate | Single nucleotides to multiple kb | Stable expression | Tightly controllable by targeting mechanism | Intracellular detection depends on the encoded cDNA | Intermediate | Currently used in one clinical trial |
| Non-Integrating Vectors | Highly efficient | No packaging limitation | Mainly transient expression | n.a. | Low immunogenicity, no risk of genotoxicity when using mRNA | Low | Well represented in clinical trials |
