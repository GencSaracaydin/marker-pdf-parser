The research paper does not explicitly contain a section titled "PROCEDURE." However, it does provide detailed information about various steps involved in CAR-T cell manufacturing throughout the text. Below is a summary of the relevant procedures extracted from the content:

### **Summary of Procedures in CAR-T Cell Manufacturing**

1. **Selection of the Starting Material**:
   - **Autologous vs. Allogeneic Transplantation**: 
     - Autologous CAR-T cell therapy involves extracting T cells from a patient and re-infusing them after engineering. 
     - Allogeneic CAR-T therapy uses T cells from healthy donors, offering a standardized and readily available option.

2. **T-Cell Enrichment Methods**:
   - Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are collected through leukapheresis or density gradient centrifugation.
   - T cells are enriched using positive or negative selection methods with paramagnetic beads labeled with antibodies (e.g., anti-CD4/CD8 or anti-CD3).

3. **T-Cell Activation and Differentiation**:
   - T cells are activated using free or bead-coated anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies.
   - Cytokines such as IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 are used to promote T-cell proliferation and influence their differentiation into memory T cells.

4. **Transduction of Activated T Cells**:
   - **Viral Methods**: 
     - Î³-retroviruses and lentiviruses are used for genetic modification to ensure stable expression of the CAR.
   - **Non-Viral Methods**: 
     - Techniques such as transposons, CRISPR/Cas9, minicircle DNA, and nanoparticles are explored for gene transfer.

5. **Cytotoxicity Assessment**:
   - Cytotoxicity assays are performed to evaluate the killing ability of CAR-T cells against target tumor cells, using methods like the chromium release assay, flow cytometry, and ELISA for cytokine production.

6. **Automation of CAR-T Cell Production**:
   - Semi-automated systems like CliniMACS Prodigy and Cocoon are utilized to ensure standardized and cost-effective production of CAR-T cells.
