Based on my review of the paper, there does not appear to be a dedicated "Procedure" or "Methodology" section. However, the key experimental procedures are described throughout the Results section and in the Methods section at the end of the paper. Here is a summary of the main experimental procedures described:

1. Generation of lentiviral vectors encoding CAR19 or iRFP

2. Isolation of T cells from peripheral blood of healthy donors and patients

3. Transduction of non-activated T cells with lentiviral vectors under various conditions:
   - Serum starvation
   - Addition of deoxynucleosides 
   - Optimization of culture vessel geometry

4. Flow cytometry analysis of transduced T cells

5. In vivo xenograft models:
   - Injection of luciferase-expressing leukemia cells into NSG mice
   - Adoptive transfer of CAR T cells 
   - Bioluminescence imaging to track tumor burden
   - Analysis of T cell persistence in blood

6. Cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity assays

7. Integration site analysis of lentiviral vectors

8. qPCR analysis of vector copy number

The Methods section provides more detailed protocols for many of these procedures. The key experimental approaches involved optimizing lentiviral transduction of non-activated T cells and evaluating their anti-tumor function in mouse models compared to conventionally activated CAR T cells.
