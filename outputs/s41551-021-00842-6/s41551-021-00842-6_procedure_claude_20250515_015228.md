Based on my review of the paper, there does not appear to be a dedicated "Procedure" or "Methodology" section. The key experimental procedures are described throughout the Results section and in the Methods section at the end of the paper. Some key aspects of the methodology include:

- Generation of lentiviral vectors encoding CAR constructs
- Isolation and culture of human T cells from healthy donors and patients 
- Lentiviral transduction of non-activated T cells under various optimized conditions
- Flow cytometry analysis of T cell phenotypes and CAR expression
- In vitro cytokine production and cytotoxicity assays
- In vivo xenograft mouse models to assess anti-tumor activity of CAR T cells
- Analysis of vector integration sites

The Methods section provides more detailed protocols for many of these procedures. However, there is not a single consolidated "Procedure" section that outlines all the steps. The experimental methods are integrated throughout the Results as the different experiments are described.
